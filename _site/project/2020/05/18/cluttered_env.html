      <p>During my junior year at Rice University I worked as a research assistant for Joey Huchette on a project involving using Mixed Integer Programming to efficiently optimize quadcopter pathing through obstacle laden environments.
The technique hinged on an innovative use of a divide-and-conquer style algorithm to calculate a biclique cover of a planar-like graph representing the environment and its obstacles.
My responsibility was to implement this algorithm in Julia with speed and correctness as priority.</p>

<p>Much of my work centered on understanding the Lipton-Tarjan planar separator theorem.
Using the theorem as a starting point I wrote a number of functions in Julia implementing its principles with slight variation and compared their real-world performance as the size of the input graph changed both in number of nodes and in number of edges.
Our priority was to find a function that could quickly produce separations with balanced sides and small separators.
Once I was satisfied with the performance, I modified the fastest function to operate on finite element graphs, the planar-like meshes our quadcopter routing problem would take as input.
Finally, I implemented a divide-and-conquer style algorithm to find the biclique cover of a finite element graph a la mergesort, using the separator algorithm to partition the graph into progressively smaller pieces to recursively call the biclique cover calculating function on again.</p>

<p>So far, this project has been a great success and I hope we are able to publish soon.
The task has been extremely interesting, and I was happy to have a chance to explore my passion for performance computing in a research setting.
I am also happy this project gave me the opportunity to learn Julia, a language in which I had no prior experience but with which I am now very comfortable and productive.</p>
