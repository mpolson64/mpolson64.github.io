Hi, my name is Miles and I'm a student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Coputational and Applied Mathematics.
I currently live in Houston, and I was born and raised in the Bay Area.

Academically I'm interested in functional programming, especially is applications in distributed systems, concurrency, and parallelism, as well as mathematical optimzation theory.
I've worked on a number of vastly different projects over the past number of years, from two SWE internships at Facebook with the Site Efficiency and Rights Management teams respectively, to [optimization research in the context of quadcopter routing at Rice]({% post_url 2020-05-18-cluttered_env %}), to [a digital humanities project exploring the 19th century slave trade in Mozambique]({% post_url 2019-01-18-oceans %}).
Each of these has been a unique oporunity to utilize and develop my unique skillset that I've thoughly enjoyed.

Outside of academics and work I'm an aspiring chef, an avid cyclist, and I love to keep up to date on the newest hip-hop.
I'm excited to find out what my next big move will be!
